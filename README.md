# burger

The object of this assignment is to use an ORM for get and post routes. We also needed to use express handlebars to build layouts.

There were a few challenges for me in building this assignment. The biggest was trying to build the assignment with as little assistance as possible, while also understanding why I'm coding what I did. 

I was **surprisingly** able to get the routes to work and actually understand the relation between the config files to the models and the controller. I was also able to get the handlebars layouts to pull, but without complete success. For some reason the lists of devoured and not devoured burgers would not render onto the page.

As the data persists through refreshes from the database as well.

While attempting to deploy the assignment to heroku, I was not able to get the JawsDB MySQL provision to work. I've included an image of the an image of that in the [images](/public/img/heroku.png).
